# Spotify Song Prediction: Project Overview

The goal of this project is to use predictive modelling to understand which features of a song can predetermine its popularity and simultaneously, build a reproducible model that could possibly be used in other industries. The two algorithms used to carry out this task were Linear Regression and Catboost Regressor. Both models were evaluated using r2 and mean absolute error as perfomance metrics.
